# Comparative Deconvolution Analysis of the Canine and Human Osteosarcoma Tumor Microenvironment
This repository contains the scripts to perform large-scale comparative deconvolution analysis of the canine and human Osteosarcoma tumor microenvironment

Osteosarcoma is a relatively rare but aggressive cancer of the bones with a shortage of effective biomarkers. Although less common in humans, Osteosarcomas are fairly common in adult pet dogs and have been shown to share many similarities with their human analogs. In this work, we analyze bulk transcriptomic data of 213 primary and 100 metastatic Osteosarcoma samples from 210 pet dogs enrolled in nation-wide clinical trials to uncover three Tumor Microenvironment (TME)-based subtypes: Immune Enriched (IE), Immune Enriched Dense Extra-Cellular Matrix-like (IE-ECM) and Immune Desert (ID) with distinct cell type compositions, oncogenic pathway activity and chromosomal instability. Furthermore, leveraging bulk transcriptomic data of canine primary tumors and their matched metastases from different sites, we characterize how the Osteosarcoma TME evolves from primary to metastatic disease in a standard of care clinical setting and assess its overall impact on clinical outcomes of canines. Most importantly, we analyze multiple bulk and single cell transcriptomic datasets of human Osteosarcomas spanning 405 patients to find that TME-based subtypes of canine Osteosarcomas are conserved in humans and predictive of progression free survival outcomes, independently of known prognostic factors such as presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis and percent necrosis following chemotherapy. In summary, these results demonstrate the power of using canines to model the human Osteosarcoma TME and discover novel biomarkers for clinical translation.
